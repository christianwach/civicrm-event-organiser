Keep Event Organiser plugin Events in sync with CiviCRM Events.



== Description ==

A WordPress plugin for syncing Event Organiser Events, Venues and Event Categories to their corresponding entities in CiviCRM.

*Important note:* Please do not use with *CiviCRM 5.47*. Your Events in CiviCRM will not respect Daylight Savings offsets.

#### ACF Integration

This plugin is compatible with [CiviCRM Profile Sync](https://wordpress.org/plugins/civicrm-wp-profile-sync/) which enables integration of Custom Fields on CiviCRM Events with ACF Fields attached to the Event Organiser "Event" Post Type.

*Important note:* Please make sure you have *CiviCRM Profile Sync* version 0.5 or greater.

*CiviCRM Event Organiser* supplies a custom ACF Field called "CiviCRM Event ID" which can be used for Event Organiser Events that have a one-to-one correspondence with CiviCRM Events. The field *will not work* as expected for synced recurring Events.

This ACF Field is useful if, for example, you want to embed an ACF Extended form in an Event Organiser Event template - because the form can access the ID of the synced CiviCRM Event and target it for various operations. Use the syntax `{get_field:your_civicrm_event_id_field}` to access the CiviCRM Event ID.

### Known Issues

There is currently no proper integration with CiviCRM's implementation of repeating events in version 4.7.n because, at present, CiviCRM does not save (or expose) the schedule that generates the sequence. To get around this limitation, this plugin prioritises a workflow based on creating events in Event Organiser and then (optionally, via the "CiviCRM Settings" metabox on the event's edit page) passing the data over to CiviCRM when requested.

The plugin implements automatic linking to an event's online registration page(s) via the [`eventorganiser_additional_event_meta`](https://github.com/boonebgorges/Event-Organiser/commit/1c94d707741b12d5a8731fc39507aa80af805c4a) hook which has been available since Event Organiser 2.12.5. If you have overridden the *Event Organiser* template(s) you may have to apply the function to the appropriate hook in your template(s) yourself. See the documentation for the function `civicrm_event_organiser_register_links()` for details. Thanks to [Consilience Media](https://github.com/consilience/) for providing the resources to push this forward.

### Apple Calendar compatibility

There is an issue with [Apple Calendar's display of Event Organiser iCal feeds](https://github.com/stephenharris/Event-Organiser/issues/356) which means that Apple Calendar requires special handling. To solve this, you can install the [Event Organiser ICS Feed for Apple Calendar](https://github.com/christianwach/event-organiser-apple-cal) plugin and use its shortcode instead of the one supplied by Event Organiser.

### Requirements

This plugin recommends a minimum of WordPress 4.9 and CiviCRM 5.75 (the latest ESR).

It also requires:

* [Event Organiser](https://wordpress.org/plugins/event-organiser/) version 3.0 or greater
* [Radio Buttons for Taxonomies](https://wordpress.org/plugins/radio-buttons-for-taxonomies/) to ensure only one event type is selected

#### Locations fixes

If you are using a version of CiviCRM lower than *CiviCRM 5.49.0* then you should apply [this patch](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23041) to get Event Locations to work as expected.

Be aware that this plugin is in active development. Test often, test thoroughly and open an issue if you find a problem.
